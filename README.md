### STARNET

* The Stockholm Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Networks Engineering Task study (STARNET) genotyped and RNA sequenced seven different tissue samples from over 600 patients undergoing bypass surgery for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). 

* Tissue samples include whole blood (Blood), atherosclerotic-lesion free internal mammary artery (MAM), atherosclerotic aortic root (AOR), subcutaneous fat (SF), visceral abdominal fat (VAF), skeletal muscle (SKLM), and liver (LIV).

* 974 unique proteins have been measured in blood plasma for 535 patients using the Olink Target96 platform.

* This repository was created to accompany the paper "Plasma proteins are integral to gene-regulatory networks acting within and across blood cells, the arterial wall and major metabolic organs".
